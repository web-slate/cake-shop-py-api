# Install Python 3

# Instal PIP3
pip / pip3 is a de facto standard package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. 

# Instal pipx
pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python.  

```
brew install pipx
```

# Install virtualenv
virtualenv is a CLI tool that needs a Python interpreter to run. If you already have a Python 3.5+ interpreter the best is to use pipx to install virtualenv into an isolated environment. 

```
pipx install virtualenv
```

```
pipx ensurepath
```
